# maximal-minimal

A short, friendly README for the "maximal-minimal" project.

## Overview

maximal-minimal is a repository for exploring the balance between maximal and minimal design/implementation approaches. This repository contains example code and notes that compare larger feature-rich solutions with smaller, minimal implementations. Use this project as a learning resource, reference, or starting point for experiments.

## What you'll find here

- Example implementations demonstrating minimal and maximal approaches.
- Notes and rationale explaining trade-offs.
- Small scripts and utilities to compare behavior and performance.
